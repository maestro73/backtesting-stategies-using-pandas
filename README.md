# backtesting-stategies-using-pandas

In this repo you will find a jupyter notebook with what is (hopefully) as useful pandas template for simple backtests.

Please note, Pandas does not really like being used iteratively and is actually slower than using basic lists of arrays. However, for intial testing the convenience and speed of experimenting do in my opinion balance this out. Once you have sketched a strategy using the pandas backtester, you may wish to build your own for larger voumes of data across markets.

Also in this repo is an example of some detailed analysis on the relationship between pairs of Altcoins and the new Alt index over at FTX. It uses FTX restAPI to grab the data.
